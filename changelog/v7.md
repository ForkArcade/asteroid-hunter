# v7 — Difficulty increase + expanded narrative

**Issue:** [#1 Game is too easy](https://github.com/ForkArcade/asteroid-hunter/issues/1)
**Category:** balance

## Changes

### Difficulty
- Shoot cooldown: 120ms -> 200ms (less spam, more aim)
- Asteroid base speed: 1.5 -> 2.0 (faster incoming rocks)
- Station HP: 25 -> 20 (less margin for error)
- Station repair rate: 0.3 -> 0.15 HP/s (station can't heal itself easily)
- Ship repair rate: 0.5 -> 0.35 HP/s (docking repairs slower)
- Fuel consumption: 4 -> 5/s (burns faster)
- Fuel refuel rate: 15 -> 10/s (refueling takes longer)
- Wave delay: 3s -> 2.5s (less breathing room)
- Wave composition: later waves now spawn mixed asteroid types (medium from wave 3, small from wave 6) in addition to large ones
- Wave scaling: large count uses 0.8x multiplier instead of 1x, but additional medium/small asteroids add total pressure

### Narrative
- Added wave 7 ("Asteroid storm") and wave 15 ("Gravitational cascade") narrative nodes
- Added survival time milestones: 60s, 180s, 300s with unique comms messages
- Added ship damage narrative: warning at 3 parts remaining, critical at 1 part (core only)
- Total narrative nodes: 17 -> 24

## Reasoning

The original difficulty was too forgiving — fast fire rate, generous repairs, and linear wave scaling meant experienced players could survive indefinitely. The changes create more pressure: faster asteroids, slower healing, mixed wave composition, and fuel management becomes a real concern. Narrative expansion gives players milestones to reach and builds tension as the situation escalates.

## Files modified

- `data.js` — config values (cooldown, speeds, HP, rates), new narrative nodes + text
- `ship.js` — mixed wave spawning, survival time triggers, ship damage narrative
- `main.js` — survival narrative update call in game loop
